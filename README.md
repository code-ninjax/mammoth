# 🐘 Mammoth — Decentralized Storage for the BlockDAG Ecosystem

Mammoth is a decentralized storage layer purpose-built for the **BlockDAG (BDAG) ecosystem**.  
It enables users and developers to **store, manage, and share on-chain data** with speed, security, and transparency.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Centralized storage solutions are risky, expensive, and prone to censorship.  
BlockDAG currently lacks a native storage infrastructure, leaving developers struggling to store metadata, images, and dApp files.  

**Mammoth solves this problem** by providing a **peer-to-peer, censorship-resistant, and permanent storage layer** optimized for BDAG applications.

---

## ✨ Key Features (MVP)

- **Upload & Pin Files** — Store files permanently on the decentralized network  
- **Decentralized Storage Nodes** — Distributed architecture ensures resilience and scalability  
- **Wallet-Based Authentication (BDAG Wallet)** — Secure access tied to BDAG identity  
- **Developer API** — Simple integration for dApps and services  
- **File Hashing + Metadata** — Immutable references for stored data  
- **Public/Private File Access** — Flexible permissions for users and developers  
- **Usage Dashboard** — Track storage usage and manage files easily  

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Connect your **BDAG Wallet**  
2. Upload files to Mammoth  
3. Files are stored across decentralized nodes  
4. Access or integrate files into BDAG dApps anytime  

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- Store **NFT metadata** for BDAG NFT projects  
- Backend file storage for **BDAG dApps**  
- On-chain storage for **images, videos, and documents**  
- Permanent archiving for creators and institutions  
- Infrastructure for **future BlockDAG applications**  

---
